# Linked List 

Day 1 of Learning LinkedList: 

1st---> I created A Custom Linkedin By Manually adding Address to Nodes
	Getting Clear understanding of How the Node Are Acutally created and Store Data And Address of Next Data

2nd ---> I Created a class  For Node And LinkedList And ADD features in it 
         1.Create LinkedList
		 2.Len of LinkedList
		 3.Append
		 4.Traverse --> Useing Magic Method (__str__)
		 5.Insert
		 -->(i)From Head
		 	(ii)From Tail
			(iii)Using Index
		 6.Delete
		 -->(i)From Head
		 	(ii)From Tail
		 7.Search
		 -->(i)  Using Value


Day 2 of Learning LinkedList: 

1st ---> I Created a Doubly LinkedList
	---> Including Previous Node Address
	---> Help In Performing Back and Forward Traversal


2nd ---> I add Methods In MY LinkedList
        (i)Peak()--> It returns the Peak Element Of LinkedList
		(ii)Forward()--> It returns The Next Node Of head
		(iii)backward() --> It returns The Previous Node 

		Note:
		--> Building This Many Problem arives 
		--> So i created A Class Veriable Peak To maintain for ALl Methods 


Day 3 of Learning LinkedList:

	1st --->Solve a Question Using LinkedList
			 Question 1--> Write a Python Program to find the maximum value in a linkedlist:

			 #Question 2--->Given a Linkedlist containing whole numbers,write a python function which finds and returns the Sum of all the elements at the odd position in the given linkedlist:

			 Question 3--->Write a program to reverse the Linkedlist:

			 # Question 4 ---> Remove Duplicates From Linkedlist:
