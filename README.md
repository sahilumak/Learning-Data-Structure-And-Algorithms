# Sahil's DSA Learning Journey

A step-by-step log of my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning. Each topic folder contains notes, code, and practice problems. 
The `/blog` folder has write-ups of what I learned, pitfalls, and interview-style insights.

---

## ğŸš€ Goals
- Build solid intuition for core DS & Algo topics.
- Maintain clean, working code with tests.
- Share learning through concise blog posts.

## ğŸ§­ Roadmap & Progress
- [x] Arrays â€” basics, two-pointer, sliding window intro
- [x] Linked List â€” singly, doubly, fast/slow pointers (current)
- [x] Stack & Queue
- [ ] Hashing (HashMap / Dictionary)
- [ ] Recursion & Backtracking
- [ ] Trees (BST, traversal, DFS/BFS)
- [ ] Heaps & Priority Queue
- [ ] Graphs (BFS/DFS, shortest paths)
- [ ] Greedy
- [ ] Dynamic Programming

> I update this checklist as I learn and push code.
